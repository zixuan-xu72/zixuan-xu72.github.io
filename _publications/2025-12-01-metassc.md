## Abstract

Semantic scene completion (SSC) plays a pivotal role in achieving comprehensive perceptions of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods often neglect the high deployment costs of SSC in real-world applications, and traditional architectures such as three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) and self-attention mechanisms struggle to efficiently capture long-range dependencies within 3D voxel grids, limiting their effectiveness. 

To address these challenges, we propose MetaSSC, a novel meta-learning-based framework for SSC that leverages deformable convolution, large-kernel attention, and the Mamba (D-LKA-M) model. Our approach begins with a voxel-based semantic segmentation (SS) pretraining task, which is designed to explore the semantics and geometry of incomplete regions while acquiring transferable meta-knowledge. Using simulated cooperative perception scenarios, we demonstrate that our framework not only reduces deployment costs but also enhances the model's adaptability to diverse driving environments.

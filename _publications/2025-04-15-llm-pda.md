## Abstract

Current driver assistance systems lack personalization. We developed an LLM-based Personalized Driver Agent (LLM-PDA) with a cognitive architecture (memory, perception, control, action) providing personalized multimodal warnings (visual, voice, tactile). Using Vision-Language Models, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and a novel MultiQuery-RAG for knowledge integration, the LLM-PDA effectively customizes assistance for diverse drivers (e.g., older, inexperienced, impaired) in various scenarios, enhancing safety and human-vehicle interaction. This pioneers LLM use in automotive multimodal HMI.

## Key Contributions

- Development of a novel LLM-based Personalized Driver Agent (LLM-PDA)
- Implementation of a cognitive architecture for personalized driver assistance
- Integration of Vision-Language Models and Chain-of-Thought reasoning
- Introduction of MultiQuery-RAG for knowledge integration in driver assistance systems

## Implications

This research represents a significant advancement in personalized driver assistance systems, offering the potential to enhance safety and improve human-machine interactions in autonomous vehicles through adaptive, context-aware, and personalized assistance.

## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel multimodal warning system for driver assistance powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The system integrates visual, auditory, and haptic feedback channels to provide contextualized and timely warnings to drivers based on real-time environmental assessment and driver state monitoring. By leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, our system can generate appropriate warnings tailored to specific driving situations and individual driver characteristics. Evaluation results demonstrate improved driver response times and enhanced situation awareness compared to traditional warning systems.

## Key Contributions

- Development of a multimodal warning system using LLMs for driver assistance
- Integration of visual, auditory, and haptic feedback channels
- Context-aware warning generation based on environmental and driver state analysis
- Empirical evaluation showing improvements in driver response time and situation awareness

## Future Work

Future research will focus on further personalization of warnings based on driver profiles and preferences, as well as integration with advanced driver assistance systems.

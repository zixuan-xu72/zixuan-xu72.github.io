## Abstract

This paper presents LLM-TripPlanner, a novel Large-Language-Model-based agent designed for personalized trip planning. By leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, our system can generate customized travel itineraries that consider user preferences, constraints, and real-time information. The system demonstrates improved user satisfaction and planning efficiency compared to traditional trip planning tools.

## Key Contributions

- Development of an LLM-based agent architecture for trip planning
- Integration of personalization mechanisms based on user preferences
- Evaluation showing improved user satisfaction and planning quality

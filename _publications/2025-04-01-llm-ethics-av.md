## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in autonomous driving, yet their ethical decision-making remains under-explored. This study proposes a framework to evaluate LLM ethics using a stated preference survey with 13,122 dilemma scenarios involving factors like group size, age, and risk. Analyzing GPT-4 series and Mistral-Large models via binary logit and decision trees reveals significant differences in preferences (e.g., prioritizing pedestrians) and sensitivities to factors like estimated deaths, age, and gender. Findings provide insights for responsible AI development in AVs.

## Key Findings

- LLMs show distinct ethical preferences when facing moral dilemmas in autonomous driving scenarios
- GPT-4 and Mistral-Large models exhibit different sensitivities to factors such as age, gender, and estimated casualties
- The proposed framework enables systematic evaluation of ethical decision-making in AI systems

## Implications

This research has significant implications for the development of responsible AI systems in autonomous vehicles, providing a structured approach to understanding and evaluating ethical decision-making processes.

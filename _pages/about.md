Hello, I am Zixuan, a Ph.D. student in Transportation at the [Cho Chun Shik Graduate School of Mobility](https://mobility.kaist.ac.kr/), Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I work in the [🚗 HumanFACTS Lab](https://human-facts.kaist.ac.kr/) under the supervision of [Dr. Tiantian(Nicole) Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/chentiantian/home), where we are dedicated to advancing transportation safety through human-centered research and innovation.

My research interest lies in the intersection of <span style="color: #FF8C00;font-weight: 600;">Generative AI</span>, <span style="color: #FF8C00;font-weight: 600;">Human-Machine Interaction (HMI)</span>, <span style="color: #FF8C00;font-weight: 600;">Traffic Safety</span>, and <span style="color: #FF8C00;font-weight: 600;">Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)</span>. I focus on leveraging advanced AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to create safer, more intuitive, and personalized interactions within intelligent transportation systems. This includes exploring human factors, communication methods, and interface design for AVs. 

Additionally, my work addresses critical safety and societal considerations essential for the responsible deployment of intelligent vehicles, specifically examining <span style="color: #FF8C00;font-weight: 600;">AI trustworthiness</span>, <span style="color: #FF8C00;font-weight: 600;">cybersecurity</span> and <span style="color: #FF8C00;font-weight: 600;"> ethical</span> challenges.

## Research Vision

During my PhD stage, I seek to answer several questions about our future with intelligent systems, including but not limited to:

-  🤖 **LLMs for AV Interaction**: How can LLMs enhance human-machine interaction in autonomous vehicles (applications, function, reliance)?

- 🔍 **AI Evaluation & Validation**: How can we effectively evaluate AI for AV HMI to ensure reliability, robustness, and alignment with human values/safety?

- 🧠 **Human Behavior Modeling**: How can computational models accurately capture and predict human behavior/intentions in transportation?




<div style="padding: 15px 0;">
  🔬🤝<strong>I am always excited to learn from and collaborate with others interested in these areas. Currently, my primary focus is on applying LLMs to solve human-machine interaction challenges (centering on drivers, passengers, and pedestrians) for AVs.</strong>

Hello, I am Zixuan. I am a Ph.D. student in Transportation at the Cho Chun Shik Graduate School of Mobility at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I work in the HumanFACTS Lab under the supervision of Dr. Tiantian(Nicole) Chen, where we dedicated to advancing transportation safety through human-centered research and innovation.

My research interest lies in the intersection of Generative AI, Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). I focus on leveraging advanced AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to create safer, more intuitive, and personalized interactions within intelligent transportation systems. This includes exploring human factors, communication methods, and interface design for AVs. 

Additionally, my work addresses critical safety and societal considerations essential for the responsible deployment of intelligent vehicles, specifically examining AI ethics and cybersecurity challenges.


## Research Vision

During my PhD stage, I seeks to answer fundamental questions about our future with intelligent systems:

- How can we develop computational models that accurately capture and predict human behavior and intentions?
- What principles and designs enable more intuitive, effective, and trustworthy interactions between humans and increasingly intelligent systems like AVs?
- How can we ensure the development and deployment of AI systems that are not only reliable and robust but also fundamentally human-centric, aligning with human values, safety needs, and ethical considerations?

## Research Interests

- **Generative AI**: Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Reasoning model
- **Human-Machine Interaction (HMI)**: Multimodal interaction, Human-In-The-Loop interaction 
- **Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)**: Driver assistance systems, hazard perception, trustworthy of AVs
- **AI Ethics & Safety**: Ethical decision-making, trust, transparency
- **Human Factors & Ergonomics**: Driver behavior modelling, cognitive modeling, user-centered design

I’m always exclited to learn from and collaborate with those interested in my research! Currently, my main focus is on applying LLMs to in sovling Human-machine interaction promlem(driver, passenger, pedestrian centric) for AVs. Feel free to reach out via email (zixuan.xu@kaist.ac.kr)—I’d love to connect and discuss further!

Hello, I am Zixuan. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Transportation Engineering at the Cho Chun Shik Graduate School of Mobility at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I work in the HumanFACTS Lab under the supervision of Professor Tiantianchen, where we focus on advancing transportation systems through artificial intelligence and human-centered design.

My research is situated at the intersection of Generative AI, Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). I focus on leveraging advanced AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to create safer, more intuitive, and personalized interactions within intelligent transportation systems. This includes exploring human factors, communication dynamics, and interface design for AVs. Additionally, my work addresses critical safety and societal considerations essential for the responsible deployment of intelligent vehicles, specifically examining AI ethics and cybersecurity challenges.


## Research Vision

My work seeks to answer fundamental questions about our future with intelligent systems:

- How can we develop computational models that accurately capture and predict human behavior and intentions, particularly in complex interaction scenarios?
- What principles and designs enable more intuitive, effective, and trustworthy interactions between humans and increasingly intelligent systems like AVs?
- How can we ensure the development and deployment of AI systems that are not only reliable and robust but also fundamentally human-centric, aligning with human values, safety needs, and ethical considerations?

## Research Interests

- **Generative AI**: Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
- **Human-Machine Interaction (HMI)**: Interface design, multimodal interaction
- **Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)**: Driver assistance systems, intelligent transportation
- **AI Ethics & Safety**: Ethical decision-making, trust, transparency
- **Human Factors & Ergonomics**: Cognitive modeling, user-centered design
- **Cybersecurity in AVs**: Threat modeling, secure system design

## Award Information

I'm honored to receive the **Second Prize in the HKSTS Outstanding Student Paper Award** for this research, which was presented at the 28th International Conference of Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies.

## Talk Abstract

This presentation discussed our novel framework for evaluating ethical decision-making in Large Language Model (LLM)-driven autonomous vehicles. We investigated how different LLMs respond to moral dilemmas involving choices between saving pedestrians or passengers.

Using a comprehensive factorial design with 13,122 scenarios that varied factors such as group size, age, gender, probability of death, and pedestrian behavior, we analyzed responses from GPT-4 series models and Mistral-Large to identify significant differences in their ethical reasoning patterns.

## Key Findings

- LLMs exhibited distinct patterns in their ethical decision-making when faced with autonomous vehicle dilemmas
- Significant differences were found in the preferences for saving different road users among tested LLMs
- The estimated number of deaths, age, and gender were found to significantly affect GPT-4's decisions
- Decision tree analysis revealed potential ethical frameworks embedded in the models' reasoning

## Implications

Our findings have important implications for the development of responsible AI systems in autonomous vehicles, providing a structured approach to understanding and evaluating the ethical reasoning of LLMs in safety-critical applications.

## Talk Abstract

This presentation introduced our LLM-based Personalized Driver Agent (LLM-PDA), a novel approach to creating adaptive and personalized driver assistance systems. The talk covered the development of a cognitive architecture that enables customized assistance for diverse driver populations through multimodal interactions.

## Key Points

- Current driver assistance systems lack personalization capabilities
- Our LLM-PDA system incorporates a cognitive architecture with memory, perception, control, and action components
- The system leverages Vision-Language Models and Chain-of-Thought reasoning
- We introduced a novel MultiQuery-RAG approach for integrating domain knowledge
- Case studies demonstrated the system's effectiveness for different driver profiles

## Discussion Topics

The presentation sparked interesting discussions on:
- Ethical considerations in personalized driver assistance
- Data privacy concerns in driver profiling
- Challenges in system validation and testing
- Regulatory implications for deployment
